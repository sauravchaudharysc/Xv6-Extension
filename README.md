# Extending xv6 to Limitless Horizons ðŸŒŒ ðŸš€ 

## Overview
This project extends the capabilities of the **xv6** operating system with key features aimed at improving its functionality and usability. The primary additions include **threads**, **locks**, and the introduction of useful user commands such as `ps` and `clear`. These features make xv6 a more versatile platform for developers and enthusiasts alike, allowing for better multitasking, synchronization, and a cleaner user interface.

## Key Features
- **Threads**: Introduced lightweight threads, enabling concurrent execution of tasks within a process.
- **Locks**: Implemented locks to ensure safe concurrent access to shared resources, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.
- **`ps` Command**: Added a process status command (`ps`) to display a list of all currently running processes, their IDs, and other relevant information.
- **`clear` Command**: Implemented the `clear` command to clear the terminal screen, providing a cleaner workspace.

## Setup
To get started with the extended xv6, follow these instructions to build and run the system.

### Prerequisites
- **Unix-like environment** (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL)
- **Make**: Tool for building the operating system

### Steps to Build and Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sauravchaudharysc/Xv6-Extension.git
   cd Xv6-Extension
2. **Open Terminal and Hit make qemu-nox**

3. **Running the Thread and Lock Test: Once xv6 is running, you can test the implementation by running the testthreads program.**

**NOTE:** We are expanding the capabilities of xv6 with exciting new features such as the `ps` and `clear` commands, with more to come. Our goal is to push the boundaries of xv6, transforming it from a foundational operating system into a versatile platform with enhanced functionality and usability for developers and enthusiasts alike.



## From XV6 Authors : 
NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

ERROR REPORTS

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
